NAME

Scalar::Number - numeric aspects of scalars

DESCRIPTION

This module is about the numeric part of plain (string) Perl scalars.
A scalar has a numeric value, which may be expressed in either the
native integer type or the native floating point type.  Many values
are expressible both ways, in which case the exact representation is
insignificant.  To fully understand Perl arithmetic it is necessary to
know about both of these representations, and the differing behaviours
of numbers according to which way they are expressible.

This module provides functions to extract the numeric part of a scalar,
classify a number by expressibility, and compare numbers across
representations.

This module is implemented in XS, with a pure Perl backup version for
systems that can't handle XS.
