version 0.001; 2007-02-05

  * bugfix: in comparison, handle all cases of integers not representable
    as floats (sclnum_val_cmp() and sclnum_id_cmp() were broken for
    systems where natint_bits > significand_bits+2)

  * bugfix: in scalar_num_part(), sclnum_is_natint(), sclnum_is_float(),
    sclnum_val_cmp(), and sclnum_id_cmp(), avoid side effects on zero
    arguments (sign of a zero can be lost via perl bug #39875 in perl-5.8
    and a similar problem in earlier perls)

  * express large test values in hexadecimal to avoid bugs in decimal
    conversions

  * test handling of zero arguments in all functions, to ensure that
    they don't destroy their signs via perl bug #39875 or the perl-5.6
    equivalent

  * loosen tests on zeroes in t/part.t to cope with perl-5.6's differing
    behaviour for numeric values of strings and dualvar(0, $_)

  * test classification with values originating both as integers and
    as floats

  * revised set of classification and comparison test cases
